# British Sign Language Detection

A deep learning project that recognizes individual British Sign Language (BSL) letters from image inputs.

## Project Overview

This project leverages computer vision and neural networks to identify British Sign Language letters from images.
The pipeline consists of:

1. **Image Processing** – Preparing input data for model training.
2. **Model Training** – Using a deep learning architecture to learn BSL letter patterns.
3. **Prediction** – Detecting and saving predicted letters to the `Predicted Letters/` folder.
4. **Visualization** – Reviewing results through annotated images.

## Repository Contents
- `ANN_TEST.ipynb`: Main Jupyter Notebook for training and evaluating the model.
- `Predicted Letters/`: Folder containing example outputs generated by the model.
- `README.md`: Project documentation.

## How to Use
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/thomasamal123/BRITISH_SIGN_LANGUAGE_DETECTION.git
   cd BRITISH_SIGN_LANGUAGE_DETECTION
   ```
2. Open `ANN_TEST.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab.
3. Run all cells to train the model and generate predictions.
4. Check the `Predicted Letters/` folder for output images.
